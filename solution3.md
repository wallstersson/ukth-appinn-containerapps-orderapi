# Challenge 3: Solution

## Solution steps
We will perform a controlled rollout of the new version and split the incoming network traffic so that only 20% of requests will be sent to the new version of the application.

We'll deploy the first version of the application to Azure and use the _curl_ tool to test the application. We will then use _Log Analytics_ to troubleshoot the application.

### Add traffic split to the HTTP API app by changing existing Bicep template
To implement the traffic split, in [v3_template.bicep](v3_template.bicep) add the traffic section on your httpapi app and save the file.

```json
  ingress: {
        external: true
        targetPort: 80
        traffic: [
          {
            revisionName: 'httpapi--${ContainerApps_HttpApi_CurrentRevisionName}'
            weight: 80
          }
          {
            latestRevision: true
            weight: 20
          }
        ]
      }
```

Effectively, we're asking for 80% of traffic to be sent to the current version (revision) of the application and 20% to be sent to the new version that's about to be deployed.

### Deploy updated Bicep template

Once again, let's repeat the deployment command from earlier, now using version 2 of the HTTP API application and with traffic splitting configured


<details>
  <summary>Bash</summary>

```bash

# Deploy Bicep template.
az deployment group create \
  -g $resourceGroup \
  --template-file v3_template.bicep \
  --parameters @v3_parametersbicep.json \
  --parameters \
    ContainerApps_Environment_Name=$containerAppEnv \
    LogAnalytics_Workspace_Name=$logAnalytics \
    AppInsights_Name=$appInsights \
    Container_Registry_Name=$acr 

```

  </summary>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PowerShell</summary>

```PowerShell

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -Name 'v3_deployment' -TemplateFile .\v3_template.bicep -TemplateParameterFile v3_template.bicep -Location $location -ContainerApps_Environment_Name $containerAppEnv -LogAnalytics_Workspace_Name $logAnalytics -AppInsights_Name $appInsights -Container_Registry_Name $acr

```

With the third iteration of our applications deployed, let's try and send another order.

<details>
  <summary>Bash</summary>
  
```bash
curl -X POST $dataURL?message=item3
```

  </summary>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PowerShell</summary>

```PowerShell

Invoke-RestMethod -Url "$dataURL?message=item3" -Method Post

```


  </summary>
</details>
<br>

And let's check the Store application again to see if the messages have been received

```bash
curl $storeURL | jq
```
### Add orders via HTTP API

With the third iteration of our applications deployed, let's try and send another order.

```bash
curl -X POST $dataURL?message=item3
```

And let's check the Store application again to see if the messages have been received

<details>
  <summary>Bash</summary>
  
```bash
curl $storeURL | jq

```

  </summary>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PowerShell</summary>

```PowerShell

Invoke-RestMethod -Url $storeUrl

```

  </summary>
</details>
<br>



```json
[
   {
    "id": "b222d3fd-9776-4631-9f1d-5038055e1541",
    "message": "fa7c4a50-a711-48d5-8d7c-b9a9e9b9056e"
  },
  {
    "id": "807fd951-7213-4fd7-8a6f-df3a8e064ed9",
    "message": "05/20/2022 22:31:26 +00:00 -- item3"
  },
]
```

> **Note**<br> 
> The traffic split is 80/20 (80% old api, 20 % new api), so you might need to send a few messages before it hits our new revision of httpapi and appends the provided string to the message.

That's looking better. We can still see the original message, but we can also now see our "item3" message with the date and time appended to it.

We configured traffic splitting, so let's see that in action. First we will need to send multiple messages to the application. We can use the load testing tool `hey` to do that.

<details>
  <summary>Bash</summary>


```bash
hey -m POST -n 25 -c 1 $dataURL?message=hello

# Verify orders in StoreApp
curl $storeURL | jq
```


  </summary>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PowerShell</summary>

```PowerShell

hey -m POST -n 25 -c 1 "$dataURL?message=hello"

# Verify orders in StoreApp
Invoke-RestMethod -Url $storeURL 

```

  </summary>
</details>
<br>

### Verify that traffic is distributed between Container App revisions 
Let's check the application logs for the Queue Reader application

```text
ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL
| where ContainerAppName_s has "queuereader" and ContainerName_s has "queuereader"
| where Log_s has "Message"
| project TimeGenerated, Log_s
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

Looking through those logs, you should see a mix of messages, with some containing "hello" and others still containing a GUID. It won't be exact, but roughly one out of every five messages should contain "hello".

So, is our app ready for primetime now? Let's change things so that the new app is now receiving all of the traffic, plus we'll also setup some scaling rules. This will allow the container apps to scale up when things are busy, and scale to zero when things are quiet.

That will be done as part of [Challenge 4](challenge4.md)
