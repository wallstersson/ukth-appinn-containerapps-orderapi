# Challenge 5: Configure CI/CD for Container Apps
Azure Container Apps allows you to use _GitHub Actions_ to publish revisions to your Container App. As commits are pushed to your GitHub repository, a GitHub Action is triggered which updates the container image in the container registry. Once the container is updated in the registry, Azure Container Apps creates a new revision based on the updated container image.

Until now we have worked with docker images that others have created, now we are going to do a code change on our own code base and push the changes to Container Apps using GitHub Actions. We are now going to use a Azure CLI command to create a GitHub Action that builds the _Queue Reader_ C# project and pushes the image to _Azure Container Registry_ and deploys it to our Container App.

The following image illustrates the steps in this challenge

## Main objectives
- Configure CI/CD deployment of a Container App using GitHub actions
- Make a code change and deploy new version of Container App
- Verify changes after deployment


## Activities
- Create an Azure AD service principal with contributor permissions on your resource group 
- Create a _Personal Access Token (PAT)_ in GitHub with permissions to your repository and GitHub actions
- Add a _GitHub Actions_ workflow to your repository to deploy a container app
- Do a code change in _Queue Reader_ app and push changes to GitHub repository
- Add a new order using _HTTP API_
- Verify that the code change has been deployed by looking in _Log Analytics_



## Definition of done
- Created an Azure AD service principal and assigned it _contributor_ access on your resource group 
- Created a _Personal Access Token (PAT)_ in GitHub with _repo_ and _workflows_ permissions
- Created a GitHub Actions workflow in your repository to deploy a container app
- Changed the C# code in _Queue Reader_ app to write a custom log message
- Pushed the changes to your GitHub repo
- Verified that the new version of your _Queue Reader_ app was successfully deployed
- Added an order by doing a _HTTP POST_ to _Http API_ (https://httpapi.[your container app environment domain]/data?message=[your message]) 
- Verified logs in _Log Analytics_ for _Queue Reader_ application that the new _Queue Reader_ Container App is logging with your custom log message
